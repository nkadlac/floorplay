# Local Development Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Already Working

Your Astro site is running at: **http://localhost:4321**

## 🔧 Setting Up Sanity CMS

### Step 1: Create Sanity Account
1. Go to [sanity.io](https://sanity.io)
2. Sign up with GitHub (or email)
3. Create a new project called "Epoxy Floor Agency"
4. Note your **Project ID** (you'll need this)

### Step 2: Update Configuration
Once you have your Project ID:

1. Open `astro.config.mjs`
2. Replace `'your-project-id'` with your actual Project ID

### Step 3: Install Sanity Dependencies
```bash
cd sanity
npm install
```

### Step 4: Update Sanity Config
1. Open `sanity/sanity.config.ts`
2. Replace `'your-project-id'` with your actual Project ID

```

This will start Sanity Studio at `http://localhost:3333`
