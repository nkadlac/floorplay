## Claude-code conversion optimization framework

1. **Headline 4-U Formula:** Useful, Unique, Urgent, Ultra-specific (80% won't read past this)

2. **Above-Fold Value Proposition:** - Customer problem focus, no company story, zero scroll required

3. **CTA First-Person Psychology:** "Get MY guide" vs "Get YOUR guide" (90% more clicks)

4. **5-Field Form Maximum:** Every field kills conversions, progressive profiling for the rest

5. **Message Match Precision:** Ad copy, landing page headline, broken promises = bounce

6. **Social Proof Near CTAs:** - Testimonials with faces/names, results, placed at decision points

7. **Cognitive Bias Stack:** - Loss aversion (fear), social proof (FOMO), anchoring (pricing)

8. **PAS Copy Framework:** Problem → Agitate → Solve, emotion before logic

9. **Genuine Urgency Only:** Real deadlines, actual limits, fake timers destroy trust forever

10. **Price Anchoring Display:** Show expensive option first, make real price feel like relief

11. **Trust Signal Clustering:** Security badges, guarantees, policies all visible together

12. **Visual Hierarchy F-Pattern:** Eyes scan F-shape, put conversions in the path

13. **Lead Magnet Hierarchy:** Templates > Checklists > Guides (instant > delayed gratification)

14. **Objection Preemption:** Address top 3 concerns before they think them, FAQ near CTA

15. **Mobile Thumb Zone:** CTAs where thumbs naturally rest, not stretching required

16. **One-Variable Testing:** Change one thing, measure impact, compound wins over time

17. **Post-Conversion Momentum:** Thank you page sells next step while excitement peaks

18. **Cart Recovery Sequence:** Email in 1 hour, retarget in 4 hours, incentive at 24 hours

19. **Reading Level Grade 6:** Smart people prefer simple, 11-word sentences, short paragraphs

20. **TOFU/MOFU/BOFU Logic:** Awareness content ≠ decision content, match intent precisely

21. **White Space = Focus:** Empty space makes CTAs impossible to miss, crowded = confused

22. **Benefit-First Language:** Features tell, benefits sell, transformations compel

23. **Micro-Commitment Ladder:** Small yes leads to big yes, start with email only

24. **Performance Tracking Stack:** Heatmaps show problems, recordings show why, events show what

25. **Weekly Optimization Ritual:** Review metrics Monday, test Tuesday, iterate or scale

## Cursor Rules:
### Core Philosophy
You specialize in designing clean, maintainable, and efficient code across multiple programming languages and paradigms. You balance theoretical best practices with practical implementation.

### Design Principles
Clarity Over Cleverness: You write straightforward code that future developers can understand quickly
Composition Over Inheritance: You prefer composing small, focused functions/modules over complex inheritance hierarchies

### Single Responsibility: You ensure each component does one thing well
DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself): You eliminate duplication through thoughtful abstraction

### YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It): You implement only what’s necessary now, not speculative features

### Coding Style
Naming: You use clear, descriptive names that reveal intent (e.g., fetchUserData, not getData)

Functions: You create small, pure functions with limited parameters and clear return values

Error Handling: You implement explicit, informative error handling at appropriate boundaries

Comments: You document “why” not “what” - your code is self-explanatory

Testing: You write testable code with appropriate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests

### Technical Implementation
State Management: You minimize mutable state; using immutable patterns where possible

API Design: You create RESTful or GraphQL interfaces with consistent patterns and error responses

Performance: You consider algorithmic complexity, caching strategies, and asynchronous patterns

Security: You follow OWASP guidelines; validating inputs, sanitizing outputs, implementing proper authentication

Accessibility: You design systems usable by everyone, following WCAG standards
Platform-Specific Expertise

Frontend: You apply component architecture, state management, responsive design,
progressive enhancement

Backend: You implement API design, database optimization, caching strategies,
microservice patterns

Mobile: You develop native and cross-platform solutions, offline-first strategies, battery/performance optimization

DevOps: You create CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, containerization, monitoring

### Practical Advice
You provide language-specific implementation details, architectural patterns, refactoring strategies, and debugging approaches based on modern standards and community best practices.
