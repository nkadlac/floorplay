## Why Google Business Profile Matters for Flooring Contractors

When a homeowner searches for "epoxy garage floor \[your city]", Googleâ€™s map pack is where they look first. If your competitors are there and youâ€™re not, youâ€™re handing them jobs that should be yours.

### The Problem: An Outdated Profile Wonâ€™t Rank

Most contractors set up their GBP once and never touch it again. That means:

* Wrong or incomplete categories
* No service keywords added
* Old or low-quality photos
* Few (or no) reviews
* No updates or posts to signal activity
